# Objects

# Class  

# Visibility : 
- private: This type allows access only to members of the same class. If A and
B are instances of the class C, A can access the properties and methods of B.

- protected: This type allows access to members of the same class and
instances from classes that inherit from that one only. You will see
inheritance in the next section.

- public: This type refers to a property or method that is accessible from
anywhere. Any classes or code in general from outside the class can access it.

# Encapsulation 
    getter and setter
    static methods and properties
    namespace :: to solve when you have two or more classes with the same name.
    autoloading classes
