Chapter 2 - Web Applications with PHP

Web applications are a common thing in our lives, and they are usually very user
friendly; users do not need to understand how they work behind the scenes. As a
developer, though, you need to understand how your application works internally.
In this chapter, you will learn about:

• HTTP and how web applications make use of it
• Web applications and how to build a simple one
• Web servers and how to launch your PHP built-in web server
