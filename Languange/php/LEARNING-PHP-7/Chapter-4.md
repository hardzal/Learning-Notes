In this chapter, you will learn about the following:
    - Classes and objects
    - Visibility, static properties, and methods
    - Namespaces
    - Autoloading classes
    - Inheritance, interfaces, and traits
    - Handling exceptions
    - Design patterns
    - Anonymous functions

# Objects and Classes
 ## Objects

# Visibility, static properties, and methods 
 
 ## Visibility
 - private: This type allows access only to members of the same class. If A and B are instances of the class C, A can access the properties and methods of B.

 - protected: This type allows access to members of the same class and  instances from classes that inherit from that one only. You will see  inheritance in the next section.

 - public: This type refers to a property or method that is accessible from anywhere. Any classes or code in general from outside the class can access it.
